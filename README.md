PROJECTS IN THIS FOLDER:

Insta-Beat: A Python program designed to "build your own beat" from small collections of sounds that would be found in a digital audio workstation (DAW).

WhoSampled Database: A build of a relational database based on the WhoSampled website where community members identify samples from music, TV, film, and more in their favorite songs. This is currently a work in progress.
